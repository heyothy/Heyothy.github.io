**Shodan is an important resource for any cybersecurity professional to gather intelligence on potential vulnerabilities and threats on their own systems. While data specific to financial institutional use isn't readily available, it's safe to assume Shodan is part of their cybersecurity processes.**

### Methods we used

### Data Preview
The Shodan key we have access to is limited as to search results and number of API queries we can make. Given this, we ran a few smaller queries to demonstrate the size of the results in this truncated process. The graphic on the right shows the result counts based on a few, targeted, queries for a handful of terms that could be applicable to financial service companies.\
\
These results are only a brief example of what could be generated with a more comprehensive query. A more substantial dataset could also be generated by running and combining some of these smaller queries.
