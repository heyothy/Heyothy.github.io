### Event Correlation

**Why selected**
* Provides enhanced pattern detection – this approach is good for identifying complex patterns across multiple data points.
* Real-time Analysis – This is crucial for fraud prevention for critical environments like financial transactions.
* Reduced False Positives – Helps to filter noise from correlating unrelated events, which reduces false positives.
* Contextual Awareness – Better accuracy in identifying fraud because event correlation considers a broader context of activities.

**Value of the approach**
* Proactive Threat Detection – Organizations can take more timely actions to mitigate risks before any damage occurs.
* Automation Potential – Event correlation can feed in AI-driven cybersecurity models to automate detection and response.

**Data sources required**
* Transaction data – Financial transactions, including timestamps, amounts, account details.
* System logs – Logs from financial platforms, databases and systems that track access, usage and modifications.
* Customer Metadata –  Information related to customer profiles, credit history, or risk ratings to add contacts to transaction data.

**Analytics procedure and justification**
* Data ingestion and integration – Enables event correlation algorithms to find hidden connections across seemingly unrelated data points.
* Anomaly detection and scoring – Flags unusual activities and scores them based on risk or likelihood of fraud to help prioritize investigation efforts.
* Alert generation and reporting – Alerts generated from correlated events are fed into dashboards or automated systems for human review or AI-driven responses.

### Anomaly Detection

**Why selected**
* Early detection of suspicious activities – Identify deviations from normal behavior patterns to flag potential fraud.
* Mitigation of financial losses – Helps to mitigate losses by identifying and preventing fradulent transaction in real time.
* Protection of customer trust and loyalty – Helps preserve customer confidence by demonstrating commitment to security and fraud prevention.
* Adaptability to evolving fraud tactics – Offers flexibiity and adaptability needed to detect emerging fraud patters and stay ahead of evolving threats.

**Value of the approach**
* Early detection of new fraud types – Algorithms can reveal novel fraud patterns before recognized, enabling proactive responses.
* Scalability and automation – Anomaly detection can operate across massive datasets, automatically flagging suspicious activities, which helps to make fraud detection scalable.
* Reduced Fraud Exposure – Anomaly detection provides faster reaction times to fraud attempts, which minimizes potential losses.

**Data sources required**
* Transaction Data – Key transaction attributes such as frequency, value, location, and associated accounts form the foundation to identify outliers.
* Historical Fraud Data – Known fraud event records help refine anomaly thresholds and patterns.
* System Logs – Logs of user interactions, system responses, and operational anomalies are helpful for correlating suspicious activities.

**Analytics procedure and justification**
* Data Collection and Preprocessing – Need to gather relevant data and clean it to ensure that anomalies detected are due to actual fraud behavior, not inconsistencies or errors.
* Feature Extraction and Engineering – Identify and create features that represent important behaviors or attributes to help refine anomaly detection models.

### Forensic Analysis

**Why selected**
* Enriched post-event investigation – Focuses on in-depth examination after fraud incidents occur, reviewing how fraud was executed and identifying weaknesses in the system. 
* Extensive evidence collection – Ideal for gathering legally defensible evidence, crucial for legal action against instigators.
* Root case identification -  Critical for understanding how the fraud was facilitated and preventing future incidents.

**Value of the approach**
* Strengthens future detection systems – Enables more robust, proactive fraud detection models.
* Actionable insights – Forensic analysis provides better actionable insights by understanding the exact vulnerabilities used by instigators.
* Data-driven decisions – Provides critical data and evidence that can guide strategic decisions on cybersecurity.

**Data sources required**
* Transaction records – Detailed transaction logs, including metadata like timestamps, amounts, IP address, and locations, to trace fraudulent activity.
* System and application logs – Gather financial platform, server, database logs to track user interactions, errors, access and system events.
* Audit trails – Records of system changes, access permissions and modifications that could be exploited by cybercriminals.
* Financial documents and records – In cases of financial fraud, financial statements, invoices, and supporting documentation is important in uncovering possible fraud activity.

**Analytics procedure and justification**
* Evidence collection and preservation – This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the investigation and ensuring the evidence can be used in legal proceedings.
* Detailed data analysis – Critical step that helps to understand sophisticated or hidden fraud schemes.
* Feedback into AI models for future prevention – These help to update AI models that are used in fraud detection, making them more accurate.
