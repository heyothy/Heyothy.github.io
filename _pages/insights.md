**The financial services sector is one of the most targeted  industries for cyberattacks. This is an ever-evolving landscape where the threat actors are  always looking for ways to gain access as there is a large financial gain in doing so. At the same time, executives are often hesitant to invest in Cybersecurity. Budgets are often not robust enough for the defences, training and salaries needed.**

### How to prevent attacks

* Investing in training to keep staff as current as possible is essential.
* Early detection wherever possible is important to staying ahead of threats.
* AI can parse huge amounts of data quickly and automatically, flagging potential threats and even enacting defence measures automatically, faster than humans can react.
* Forensic analysis after a breach can help fortify defences for future attacks as much as possible.
* Visualizations help communicate vulnerable areas quickly and easily to non-technical management.

### How are attacks being conducted

* Attacks are being conducted through a myriad of methods including, but not limited to:
* Ransomware
* Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attacks
* Man in the Middle
* Phishing
* Social engineering
* Malware

### Emerging threats

* Threat actors are utilizing AI to bolster their attacks and bypass current defence systems.
* Ransomware is becoming an increasingly used attack.
* Advanced Persistent Threats (ATP) exploit things like zero-day techniques or social engineering.

TTPs of adversaries â€“ just a few examples of the many tactics that can be used:
* Social engineering : phishing e-mails, psychological manipulations, AI created messages to trick an employee, baiting etc
* Malware : viruses, worms, etc that are inadvertently introduced into the host system allowing access 
* Botnets : used in Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS)
* Zero-Day vulnerabilities : previously unknown exposure or vulnerable areas that are taken advantage of before a patch is implemented.

### Key threat actors

Who are the threat actors:
* Hacktivist groups - politically or ideologically motivated attackers who work together to compromise a systems security.
* Enemy nation-states - looking to gain access to top secret information, disrupt economic activities or other politically motivated attacks. 
* Internal actors - current or former employees, contracted employees (perhaps disgruntled or financially motivated) using their access to internal systems to take data, or perform other sorts of sabotage.
