### What are the assets
![lock](/assets/Image-assets.png)

The Financial Services industry relies on several critical assets, which are essential for its operation and security. These assets are often targeted in cyberattacks, and protecting them is a top priority. Each of these assets plays a pivotal role in the financial services industry, and disruptions or compromises to any of them can have widespread implications, from financial losses to regulatory penalties.

### Customer Data
Personally identifiable information (PII), such as social security numbers, account numbers, and credit information. Loss or theft of this data can have severe financial and legal consequences.

### Financial Transactions
Customer account data, transaction records, and financial histories are core to the industry. This includes data in systems like payment processing networks, credit card processing, and SWIFT for international transfers.

### Trading Systems
Systems that manage trading activities, including stock exchanges, commodity trading, and investment management platforms. Any disruption here could cause significant financial instability.

### Internal Networks
This includes databases, servers, and the software that financial institutions use for day-to-day operations, such as loan processing, customer account management, and compliance systems.

### Regulatory/Compliance Data
Systems that ensure adherence to legal and regulatory requirements, such as anti-money laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC), and fraud detection tools.
