### Data Breaches

Financial institutions store vast amounts of sensitive customer data, including personal details, financial records, and transaction histories. Data breaches can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and reputational damage. One high-profile example is the 2019 Capital One data breach, where a hacker gained unauthorized access to the personal information of over 100 million customers. The breach was facilitated by a misconfiguration in a web application firewall, highlighting the importance of rigorous security measures and constant monitoring of systems within financial institutions (U.S. Department of Treasury, 2024).

### Phishing and social engineering

Attackers frequently use phishing emails, malicious websites, and social engineering tactics to trick users into revealing their login credentials or financial details. One notable example is the use of AI-driven deep fake technology to enhance social engineering schemes. Attackers may create convincing fake voices or videos of trusted individuals, such as company executives, to manipulate employees into authorizing fraudulent transactions or disclosing confidential information (Flitter, 2023).

### Malware and Ransomware

Malware infections can disrupt operations, steal data, and hold systems hostage for ransom. Ransomware attacks have become increasingly sophisticated, targeting critical systems and demanding large sums of money.

### AI-Powered Attacks

Attackers are leveraging AI and machine learning to create sophisticated phishing campaigns that mimic human communication, develop malware that evades traditional antivirus detection, and automate attacks.

### Blockchain and cryptocurrency theft

Cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets, and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are targeted by ransomware attacks, phishing scams, and scams exploiting smart contract vulnerabilities.

### Insider Threats

Insiders – employees, contractors, or former employees – can pose a significant risk. They may have access to sensitive data, systems, and infrastructure, making them a potential source of breaches.

### Advanced persistent threats (APTS)

Nation-state actors like APT28 (Fancy Bear) and APT31 (Zirconium) target financial institutions for espionage, financial gain, or disruption of critical infrastructure. They employ advanced techniques like malware, phishing, and social engineering to infiltrate networks and steal sensitive data.

### Cybercrime syndicates

Organized criminal groups like FIN7, Carbanak, and Cobalt Group specialize in financial cybercrime, targeting banks, payment processors, and individuals. Their methods include ransomware, phishing attacks, and malware designed to steal financial data.

### Internet of things (IoT) security

The increasing adoption of IoT devices in financial environments like ATMs and point-of-sale terminals opens up new attack surfaces. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in IoT devices to steal data, disrupt services, or even gain physical access.
