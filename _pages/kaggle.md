**The data that we chose to use for this task is a large file with well over a million tuples of data. It wasn't specified; however, we believe it is from some sort of financial institution, like a bank. There are two columns: one for "flagged fraud" and one for "is fraud", which likely pertain to financial transactions, such as credit card purchases. These columns are critical for analyzing account balance changes and could be instrumental in building algorithms aimed at flagging and preventing fraudulent activities. Utilizing such data can significantly reduce expenses associated with fraud for our organization.**

### Value as a Data Source
Kaggle datasets are valuable resources for competitors and learners, providing them with a way to work through problems or use them as a practice simulation. This also includes access to diverse datasets with the ability to benchmark data against existing Kaggle competitions. This helps evaluate a company's existing data and fraud risks, thereby helping companies leverage this data to develop or refine their own fraud prevention. Using algorithmic training for back-testing trading models some Kaggle datasets include stock prices, trading volumes, and other financial metrics. Though the gathering and evaluation of this data a more comprehensive plan for protection can be developed and implemented.

### Data Generator
Kaggle datasets are provided by a wide range of contributors including organizations, companies, students, alumni, data scientists, enthusiasts and non-profits. 

### Data Amounts
Kaggle has thousands of datasets across vast domains, including finance, healthcare and other industries, all of which are publicly available. Files sizes range from a few kilobytes to several gigabytes.

### Why Kaggle
Based on our research Kaggle was an appropriate data source and searches for relevant financial services data yielded good sources that would work for our diamond modeling.

### Real-world application
Many organizations in the financial services industry use these data sources for a variety of reasons. This includes predictive modeling, risk management, cybersecurity and customer experience. For example, hedge funds and financial firms use financial market data sets to develop algorithms for trading strategies and forecast market trends.
